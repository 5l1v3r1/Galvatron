# Galvatron
Powershell fork of Monohard by Carlos Ganoza P.  This botnet/backdoor was designed to egress over unecrypted web using very little, but effective obfuscation.  Egress over ICMP and DNS are planned as features.  Lastly, the server code is designed to setup the C2 on a LAMP-esque server.  The default creds are admin/admin.
